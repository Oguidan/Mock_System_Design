## System Design Principles 📏
- **Scalability**: Techniques and strategies to handle increasing load. 📈
- **Reliability**: Ensuring the system is fault-tolerant and dependable. 🔒
- **Maintainability**: Designing systems that are easy to update and extend. 🛠️
- **Performance**: Optimization techniques for responsive and efficient systems. ⚡

## Design Patterns 🛠️
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. 🔄
- **Factory**: Creates objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. 🏭
- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. 👀
- **Decorator**: Allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. 🎨

## Case Studies 📚
- **Distributed Systems**: Examples and analyses of distributed architectures. 🌐
- **Microservices**: Breakdown of monolithic applications into microservices. 🧩
- **Load Balancing**: Strategies for distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers. ⚖️
